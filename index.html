    <h3 class="mt-3">How does JavaScript work?</h3>
    <p>
    <h5 class="fw-bold"> Answer: </h5> JavaScript works <span class="fw-bold">synchronously</span> (Only when the
    execution of the
    current line is completed it moves to next line) and it is also <span class="fw-bold">single-threaded</span>
    (Executes
    one command at a time in a
    specific order one after another serially) language.
    Every browser has a JavaScript built-in engine (e.g. Chrome use <span class="fw-bold">V8 engine</span>) that engine
    is a program which goes through all the JavaScript code and transforms it into something
    that the
    computer's CPU can understand and execute <span class="fw-bold">machine code</span>. Execute after an interpreter
    (V8 uses an interpreter called <span class="fw-bold">Ignition</span>) in the browser reads the
    JavaScript code, then <span class="fw-bold">interprets</span> each line and
    runs it. More modern browsers
    use a technology known as Just-In-Time <span class="fw-bold">(JIT)</span> compilation, which compiles JavaScript to
    executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
    When the transformation process happening , it needs to consider the specifications. Every time a function is <span
        class="fw-bold">invoked</span>, it needs to figure all these things out called <span class="fw-bold">execution
        context</span> (Rules are defined by a organization named Ecma International).
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-3">What does JavaScript event loop do?</h3>
    <p>
    <h5 class="fw-bold"> Answer: </h5>We say, JavaScript is a combination of synchronies and asynchronies event.
    Synchronies is after another, asynchronies is things like callbacks or promises and its event queue in synchronies
    event that JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop.
    A JavaScript runtime uses a message queue, which is a list of messages to be processed. Every message has an
    associated function that gets called to handle the message.
    At some point during the event loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue, starting with the oldest
    one. The message is removed from the queue and its corresponding function is called with the message as an input
    parameter. As always, calling a function creates a new stack frame for that function's use.

    An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack
    whenever the function stack becomes empty. Here the callback function in the event queue has not yet run and is
    waiting for its time into the stack when the SetTimeOut() is being executed and the Web API is making the mentioned
    wait.

    This is how javascript event loop works.
